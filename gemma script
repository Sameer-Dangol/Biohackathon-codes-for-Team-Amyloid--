GEMMA software toolkit (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

#generation of kinship matrix for relatedness
gemma -bfile lesMAFbfile -gk 1 -o relation

Association analysis for the given genotype and phenotype using GEMMA
1. General Linear Model
gemma -bfile lesMAFbfile -lm 4 -outdir . -o result_GLM

2. General Linear Model with PCA
gemma -bfile lesMAFbfile -c pca_10_covariate.txt -lm 4 -outdir . -o GLM_PCA

3. Mixed Linear Model with only Kinship matrix
gemma -bfile lesMAFbfile -k relation.cXX.txt -lmm 4 -outdir . -o MLM_K 

4. Mixed Linear Model with both K and PCA
gemma -bfile lesMAFbfile -k relation.cXX.txt -c pca_10_covariate.txt -lmm 4 -outdir . -o MLM_K_PCA

#The txt files of the linear models generated by gemma converted to dataframes which were then used to construct QQ plots and Manhattan plots.
The Manhattan plots show which SNPs have the strongest associations with the phenotype being studied.
